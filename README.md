# How to make the MEME MAKER work

1. Create `.env` file in repo
2. Register for https://beta.openai.com for the caption and https://serpdog.io for the image scraper
3. Copy your API key from: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys and for the image scraper: https://api.serpdog.io/ 
4. Add `REACT_APP_OPENAI="YOUR_API_KEY"` and `REACT_APP_DOGAPI="YOUR_API_KEY"`
